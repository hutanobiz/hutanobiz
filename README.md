## Running Flutter Gallery on Flutter's dev channel

The Flutter Gallery targets Flutter's dev channel. As such, it can take advantage
of new SDK features that haven't landed in the stable channel.

Install [Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install)

If you'd like to run Kargoo, make sure to switch to the master channel
first:

```bash
flutter channel dev
flutter upgrade
```

## Install required packages

Go to project root and execute the following commands in console to get the required packages: 

```bash
flutter pub get 
```
